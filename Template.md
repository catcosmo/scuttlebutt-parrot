People grew used to being digitally connected to friends and accuentances through social networks. Established networks provide their infrastructure in exchange for user's data (content and meta-data). This leads to a unbalanced concentration of knowledge (and thus power) on site of social media companies like facebook or google.
Apart from collecting extensive private information on their user base, these networks have a centralized architecture aand their own rules, meaning that companies control who can write what content and who will see it. They are able to censor, influence and lock out users.
