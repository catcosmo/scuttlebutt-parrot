In aligning the usability test we followed the guidelines of Steve Krug and Jakob Nielsen.
We had five test persons. They tested the general application and specific questions.
The application was built as a high-fidelity prototype in the program “justinmind”. This allowed a cross platform test as well as a simple exportability.

In the usability test, the five people each worked about 30 minutes with the application in separate sessions. We recorded the audio what the subject said. Previously, we asked the subject to "think aloud". That is, she should comment on each of her actions, formulate her expectations, and express her feelings. We observed the person and asked if we thought it necessary.
At the end the participants were asked for their opinion about the site. They should state their overall impression with a grade from 1 to 6.

Below is a sorted summary of the results.
It describes the areas in which noticed something. The observations are numbered. They are frequency and weighted (from 1 = rare or unimportant to 5 = very common or severe) to assess the importance of correcting the underlying problem.
The frequency indicates how often this problem is likely to occur (not how many times the subjects encountered it).
Then the issues were picked up and fixed in the next development round. Serious problems that occur frequently are eliminated first.
To remedy the problems had to be weighed with how much effort the elimination is connected.
1) Overall impression and CI of the application.

The first impression or the general CI of the application pleased the test persons. Overall, the first handling was well received. And the test subjects gave the feedback that it invited them to keep busy with the application.

Observation 1.2
Two of the five subjects found the amount of text on the homepage too large. They wanted an even clearer structure. A test person irritated the statement that 10 percent of the comrades are under 35, they felt this detail information at this point as unimportant.

2) Menu
We had asked the subjects to search the menu and give feedback.
That we had used a common burger menu, users had no difficulty with it and found it self-explanatory.

3) search
The search function was perceived by all test users as self-explanatory. Displaying often searched terms was reported as positive.
4) main stream
The main page and news flow was the most viewed. Their clear structure was well received and was even praised by two test persons.

Observation 4.1
Two subjects did not find out what certain logos stood for. The remaining users were unsure as soon as it deviated from common standards. The forward message button chosen by us should be mentioned.

Overall, the application left a good impression. In such tests, users always feel watched and under pressure to find errors.
Because that's their job in this case. Therefore, it has also made a positive impact that our subjects were kept as diverse as possible.
Nevertheless, there were still some problems, but came through the high-fidelity prototype.
The fast loading times and the attention to detail were praised.
